# vanilla.js-logic-game
My second game written with Phaser! (work in progress)

Day1 - Wednesday 21:00 - Let's get started! The plan for today: Prepare some setup some basic files.
Not sure what to do with images, normally I wouldn't put them in a repository, but this time I will.

Day2 - Thursday 12:00 - Plan for today: Add level selection, code tutorial and maybe level 1.

Update 18:00 - Added level selection
Update 22:00 - Added randomisation of block placements in tutorial

Day3 - Friday 11:40 - Plan for today: Add logic behind winning, make level1, count time, figure out how to make a nice interface

Update: 16:00 - Added level one (requires fixes), heavily refactored most of the things connected with dragging objects
Update: 19:00 - Added "go back to menu button", refactored some mechanics
Update: 20:00 - Added more interface, fixed bug with counter

Day4 - Saturday 13:00 - Plan for today: finish all levels, add timer finally

Update: 18:30 - more levels, credits
