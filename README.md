# vanilla.js-logic-game
My second game written with Phaser! (work in progress)

Day1 - Wednesday 21:00 - Let's get started! The plan for today: Prepare some setup some basic files.
Not sure what to do with images, normally I wouldn't put them in a repository, but this time I will.

Day2 - Thursday 12:00 - Plan for today: Add level selection, hardcode tutorial and maybe level 1.
